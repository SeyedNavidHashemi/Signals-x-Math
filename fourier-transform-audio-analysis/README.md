# Audio Signal Analysis using Fourier Transform

A MATLAB-based project implementing Fourier analysis techniques for audio signal processing, developed as part of an Engineering Mathematics course assignment.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Fourier Transform theory to analyze and manipulate audio signals in the frequency domain. The implementation includes signal analysis, frequency domain processing, and audio modification techniques.

## Features

- **Fourier Transform Implementation**: Application of FFT to audio signals
- **Frequency Domain Analysis**: Analysis of signal frequency components
- **Audio Signal Manipulation**: Modification of audio signals at different frequencies
- **Visualization**: Time and frequency domain signal representations

## Technologies

- MATLAB
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- Audio Processing

## Usage

Open the `CA1.mlx` file in MATLAB to run the analysis. The script demonstrates:

1. Loading and processing audio signals
2. Applying Fourier Transform for frequency analysis
3. Modifying signals in the frequency domain
4. Visualizing results with plots and spectrograms

## Key Concepts

- Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- Frequency domain analysis
- Signal filtering and modification
- Time-frequency representations

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2020b or later
- Signal Processing Toolbox
